# Hashing Functions

Hashing functions are typically designed so that inverses are nearly impossible to calculate. Restated, hashing functions take an input and generate and output in such a way that the output can not be used to determine the input. More to the point, the output often appears to be a random string of bits with no pattern.  It may come as a surprise, but these types of functions are at the heart of authentication in cryptography and cybersecurity.  Hashing functions appear in a wide variety of computer science applications and a few are listed below.

* Package manager file integrity validation
* Linked list searching
* Password comparison
* Digital signatures
* X.509 security certificates

This lecture note will mainly focus on the cybersecurity aspect of hashing functions.
