# Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show. The game show host, Monty Hall, presents the contestant with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. The contestant chooses a door, and then Monty Hall opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The contestant is then given the option to switch doors. 

**Should the contestant switch doors?**

The answer is yes. The probability of winning the car is $\frac{2}{3}$ if the contestant switches doors, and $\frac{1}{3}$ if the contestant does not switch doors.

## Counterintuitive Solution

The Monty Hall problem is counterintuitive because the probability of winning the car is uniformly distributed among the doors options.  When the contestant initially chooses a door, the probability of the car being behind that door is $\frac{1}{3}$.  The probability of that door being correct never changes. However, when Monty Hall opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat, the probability of the remaining door (not chosen or opened) doubles. 

Mathematical applications often have links to real-world scenarios and constraints that can be visualized.  Probability theory is well established and is known for its counterintuitive results.  When counterintuitive results are linked to real-world scenarios, it can give the impression that objects are moving or changing in some way that is not possible.  Almost like magic is being observed.  Probability theory is often referred to as the mathematics of magic. 

Many counterintuitive events observed by physicists and mathematicians are often linked to probability theory.  This is related to Albert Einstein's claim that quantum physics is spooky action at a distance.  

## Mathematical Approach

Despite being potentially counterintuitive, the Monty Hall problem can be proven mathematically using the law of total probability and Bayes' theorem.  The law of total probability states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the event given different conditions.  

Let $A$ be an event and $B_1, B_2, ..., B_n$ be a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.  The probability of $A$ can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of $A$ given each of the events $B_i$ multiplied by the probability of each event $B_i$.

$$P(A) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$$

Bayesian probability can be viewed in one of two ways:

1. It provides a method for calculating the probabiliby of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that may be related to the event.  
2. It provides a method of recalculating the probability of an event based on new information.

The second item above is relevant to the Monty Hall problem.  The contestant has new information after Monty Hall opens one of the doors.  The contestant can use this new information to recalculate the probability of winning the car.

### Proof

- $D_p$: The door the contestant initially picks
- $D_c$: The door with the car
- $D_m$: The door Monty Hall opens to reveal a goat
- $D_s$: The door the contestant selects after Monty Hall reveals a goat
    - $D_s = D_p$: Contestant stays with the original door
    - $D_s \neq D_p$: Constant switches doors

Let's define scenarios using logic expressions 

- $(D_s = D_c)$: The contestant wins the car.
- $( D_s = D_p)$: The contestant does not switch doors.
- $(D_s \neq D_p)$: The contestant switched doors.
- $(D_p = D_c)$: The  contestant initially picks the door with the car. 
- $(D_m = D_c)$: Monty Hall opens the door with the car.  
- $(D_m = D_p)$: Monty Hall opens the door the contestant initially picked.
- $(D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c)$: Monty Hall does not open the door with the car or the door selected by the contestant.



Consider the scenario where the contestant wins and did not switch doors.  This is logically expressed below.
$$(D_s = D_c) \land (D_s = D_p)$$

Notice the three expressions below are exhaustive and mutually exclusive with respect to the actions of Monty Hall. Two of these actions are impossible (contradictions $\bot$) implying the remaining case is a tautology ($\top$).

- $(D_m = D_c) \implies \bot \implies P(D_m = D_c) = P(\bot) = 0$
- $(D_m = D_p) \implies \bot \implies $P(D_m = D_p) = P(\bot) = 0$
- $(D_m \neq D_p) \land (D_m \neq D_c) \implies \top \implies P(D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c) = P(\top) =1$

The conditional probability the player wins without switching can be expressed using the law of total probability with respect to the actions of Monty Hall.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p) &= P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p, D_m = D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m = D_c)}_{0} \\\\
    &+ P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p, D_m = D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m = D_p)}_{0} \\\\
    &+ P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c)}_{1}
\end{align*}
$$

The above can be simplified to the expression below.

$$P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p) = P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c)$$

Converting the conditional probability to the probability of a logical expression is shown below.  Notice the conditional probability will simplify to a probability without condition.  Specifically, it becomes the probability of the player selecting the door with the car without any extra information from Monty Hall's actions.  There are three doors and so the probability will be $\frac{1}{3}$.  All of this is explained by the express below.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p) &= P(D_s = D_c | D_s = D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c) \\
&= P(\underbrace{D_s = D_c \land D_s = D_p}_{D_c = D_p} \land \underbrace{D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c}_{\top}) \\\\
&= P(D_c = D_p)
&= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

The probability the contestant wins the car without switching doors is $\frac{1}{3}$.

Now consider the probability the contestant wins the car by switching doors.  

$$P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p)$$

Using a similar total probability argument with respect to Monty Hall's actions we have the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p) &= P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p, D_m = D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m = D_c)}_{0} \\\\
    &+ P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p, D_m = D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m = D_p)}_{0} \\\\
    &+ P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c) \cdot \underbrace{P(D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c)}_{1}
\end{align*}
$$

This simplifies to the expression below.

$$P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p) = P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c)$$

Apply the logical expressions

$$
\begin{align*}
P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p) &= P(D_s = D_c | D_s \neq D_p, D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c) \\
&= P(\underbrace{D_s = D_c \land D_s \neq D_p}_{D_c \neq D_p} \land \underbrace{D_m \neq D_p \land D_m \neq D_c}_{\top}) \\\\
&= P(D_c \neq D_p) \\
&= 1 - P(D_c = D_p) \\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{3} \\
&= \frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

The probability of the contestant winning the car by switching doors is $\frac{2}{3}$



## Conclusion

The following summarizes the above proof:

* The probability of winning the car is $\frac{2}{3}$ if the contestant switches doors.
* The probability of winning the car is $\frac{1}{3}$ if the contestant does **not** switch doors.  
* Initially all doors has a probability of success of $\frac{1}{3}$.
* The probability of the door not selected by the player and not opened by Monty Hall doubles.

It is tempting to believe the game show could be reduced down to a two door choice by the contestant implying a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ for each door.  However, this is not the case.  The actions of the contestant and Monty Hall are being retained by the game. It is amost like the game is aware it is being observed.
