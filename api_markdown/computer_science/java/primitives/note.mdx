# Java Primitive Data Types

Java has 8 primitive data types that are predefined and represent basic data values. They are outlined below with the following information:

- **Size**: The number of bits used to store the value.
- **Range**: The range of values that can be stored.
- **Default Value**: The value that is assigned if no value is specified.
- **Use**: Common use cases for the data type.

### 1. `byte`
- **Size**: 8 bits (1 byte)
- **Range**: -128 to 127
- **Default Value**: 0
- **Use**: Useful for saving memory in large arrays.

### 2. `short`
- **Size**: 16 bits (2 bytes)
- **Range**: -32,768 to 32,767
- **Default Value**: 0
- **Use**: A more memory-efficient data type than `int` for small values.

### 3. `int`
- **Size**: 32 bits (4 bytes)

- **Default Value**: 0.0d
- **Use**: The default choice for decimal values for more precision.

### 7. `boolean`
- **Size**: 1 Byte (depends on JVM implementation)
- **Range**: `true` or `false`
- **Default Value**: `false`
- **Use**: For true/false values.

### 8. `char`

- **Default Value**: '\u0000'
- **Use**: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.


## Software Developer vs Software Engineer

The difference between a software developer and a software engineer is understanding the underlying hardware and how it affects the software.  Java programs run in a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which is a software abstraction of a computer.  However, the JVM is still running on a physical computer with physical memory and CPU.  Understanding the memory usage of different data types is important for writing efficient code. 

All developers want to be known for efficient code. However, the definition of efficient code can vary.  For some, efficient code is code that runs quickly.  For others, efficient code is code that uses less memory.  For others, efficient code is code that is easy to read and maintain.  The truth is that efficient code is a combination of all three.  The code should run quickly, use minimal memory, and be easy to read and maintain.  However, there are often trade-offs between these three goals.  More to the point, the trade-offs are often not obvious.

### Byte vs Short vs Int

A person would assume that since byte and short are smaller than int they would be more memory efficient. A logical assumption may be that arithmetic on a byte or short would be faster than on an int.  However, this is not the case.  The JVM is optimized for int arithmetic and that is partially due to the fact that the underlying hardware running the JVM is optimized for int arithmetic.   

The JVM only does arithmetic on ints and longs. If you use a byte or short in an arithmetic operation, the JVM will convert the byte or short to an int before doing the arithmetic.  Your computer likely has an enormous amount of memory and most applications do not require the memory savings of using byte or short.  Also, when using byte and short you have to be very aware of overflow.  Overflowing a byte or short can lead to bugs that are difficult to find.  For these reasons, it is recommended to use int for all arithmetic operations.

The data types byte and short are useful in conserving memory in large arrays. If you have an array of 1,000,000 bytes, you will save 3,000,000 bytes of memory compared to an array of 1,000,000 ints.  However, if you are not working with large arrays, it is recommended to use int for all arithmetic operations. If you plan on doing arithmetic on the values in the array, it is recommended that you profile your work to see if the memory savings of using byte or short is worth the extra CPU cycles overhead of converting the byte or short to an int. 

Java is often used in applications where data is often stored or transmitted in fixed width records.  In these cases, it is often useful to use a byte or short to represent the data.  Using these types may help other developers recognize the data structure of the record. 

### Long vs Int

The long data type is used for very large integer values that are beyond the capacity of int.  Below are some common use cases for long:

* **Timestamps**: Timestamps are often quoted as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).  When this set of notes was written the timestamp was 1728340073.  This number is larger than the maximum value of an int.  Therefore, a long is required to store this value.  Since a long is so much larger than an int, it is often used to store timestamps in milliseconds or nanoseconds.
* **File Sizes**: File sizes are often quoted in bytes.  Files are often several gigabytes in size and those values are large and cannot be represented using an int.  Therefore, a long is often required to store file sizes.
* **Memory Addresses**: Memory addresses are often quoted in bytes.  Memory addresses are often larger than the maximum value of an int.  Therefore, a long is required to store memory addresses.

Most versions of JVM have been optimized for int and long arithmetic.  However, long types do require more space and may require slightly more CPU cycles to perform arithmetic operations.  Developers should use int types when possible. There is a potential readbility and development time cost associated with using long types when they are not necessary. When a developer sees a long type in code, the developer will likely assume it is required and will spend extra time understanding the code.  Therefore, it is recommended to use long types only when necessary.

### Float vs Double

Computers often need to deal with numbers that are not integers.  Scientific calculations can entail arithmetic on values that are magnitudes different.  Most programming languages have two data types to represent non-integer values.  Float is a single precision floating point number and double is a double precision floating point number.

As a computer scientist and computer engineer make sure you are familiar with IEEE standard 754 for floating point numbers.  The IEEE standard 754 is a technical standard for floating-point computation established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  Prior to this standard various companies and organizations were implementing their own versions of handling non-integer values.  Portability was a nightmare.  Floating point arithmetic can be quite complicated to understand but it is necessary.  Essentially floating point arithmetic is how a computer deals with values that are not integers.  Floating point arithmetic is used to represent fractional numbers.  

Floating point arithmetic allows for negative and positive numbers, zero, and infinity.  Single precision (float) arithmetic is often much faster than double precision (double) arithmetic.  However, double precision arithmetic is much more accurate.  **The default choice for decimal values should be double.**  As a result, Java assumes all floating point arithmetic is double precision unless marked otherwise.  Therefore, if you want to use a float you must append an 'f' to the number.  For example, 3.14 is a double and 3.14f is a float.

### Boolean

A boolean value can be true or false.  Technically, a boolean can be stored with a unit as small as one bit. However, most JVM implementations and versions store a boolean as a byte.  Keep in mind that readability is important in software development.  If you are dealing with true/false values then use the boolean type to represent them.  Expect that an array of booleans will consume about one byte per boolean.  This might vary depending on the JVM implementation. Avoid attempting to optimize memory usage associated with booleans with bit manipulation.  Bit manipulation can lead to bugs that are difficult to find.  The memory savings of bit manipulation are often not worth the extra development time and potential bugs. Also, bit twiddling hacks do not provide the same performance benefits in Java as they do in C or C++.  Remember Java operates in an abstracted environment layers above the hardware.

### Char

Similar to C/C++ the char type can handle numerical values. You typically want to use a char for single character representations. Char literals are denoted with single quotes.  For example 'a' is a char and "a" is a string in Java and in many other languages.  The single quote 'a' would be suitable for a char type. The char type is often printed as a single letter or number but really represent 16 bit unicode values.  The letter 'a' has unicode value 65 and the letter 'A' has value 97.  Unless you are working with unicode values you can think of a char as a single letter or number.  Developers that utilize C often use arrays of chars to form strings.  Java allows for the same implementation, but Java has a String class that is more efficient and easier to use than char arrays. 

# Signed vs Unsigned

Java does not natively provide unsigned data types. Folks familiar with C/C++ often find this to be an annoying aspect of Java.  Keep in mind that C/C++ developers are often working closer to the hardware and some benefits of unsigned data types are lost in the JVM environment (abstraction layers above the hardware).    The Integer class does provide methods for handling signed and unsigned values but this comes with a performance cost.  Keep in mind that Java is oriented toward safe and rapid development.  Mixing signed and unsigned values can create bugs that are difficult to find and fix.  More to the point, the unsigned version of a data type in C/C++ only doubles the range.  It is not common to need the extra range provided by an unsigned data type.  Unsigned data types are often implemented for specific bit twiddling implementations in C/C++.

Keep in mind that char is a data type capable of representing numbers but not for typical usage.  Char does have a range of 0 to 65535 implying it is signed.  Below is a table that provides the bounds for the integer data types in Java.
