# Basic Java Class Keywords

Java provides several keywords that can be used to define classes and their members. These keywords help in defining the structure, behavior, and access control of classes and their members. 

## Keywords for Class Variables

* **private**:
   - The variable is only accessible within the class it is declared in.
   - Other classes, even subclasses, cannot directly access or modify the variable.
   - It is used to encapsulate data and provide controlled access through getters and setters.

* **public**:
   - The variable is accessible from any other class or object in the program.
   - It can be accessed directly without restrictions, which can lead to less secure code if not managed properly.

* **protected**:
   - The variable is accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.
   - It's useful in inheritance when you want to allow controlled access to class members by child classes while still restricting access from other classes in different packages.
   - Behaves like public within the same class and extends to subclasses and classes.
   - Behaves like private to external classes. 

* **final**:
   - The variable can only be assigned a value once. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.
   - This keyword can be combined with access modifiers (`private final`, `public final`, etc.) to control visibility and immutability.
   - A `final` variable must be initialized at the time of declaration or in the constructor.


## Keywords for Class Methods

* **static**:
   - The method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
   - It can be called without creating an instance of the class.
   - Static methods can access static variables and other static methods directly.

* **private**:
   - The method is only accessible within the class it is declared in.
   - Other classes, even subclasses, cannot directly access or invoke the method.
   - It is used to encapsulate behavior and provide controlled access through public methods.

* **public**:
    - The method is accessible from any other class or object in the program.
    - It can be invoked directly without restrictions, which can lead to less secure code if not managed properly.

* **protected**:
    - The method is accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.
    - It's useful in inheritance when you want to allow controlled access to class methods by child classes while still restricting access from other classes in different packages.
    - Behaves like public within the same class and extends to subclasses.
    - Behaves like private to external classes.

* **final**:
    - The method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
    - It can be used to prevent subclasses from changing the behavior of a method defined in the superclass.
    - A `final` method can still be inherited but cannot be overridden.

## Conclusion

Understanding the above keywords is critical for designing classes in Java. Correct implementation of keyword will make your code more readable, portable, maintainable, and professional.
