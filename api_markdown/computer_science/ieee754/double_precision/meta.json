    "title" : "IEEE 754 - Double Precision Floating Point Arithmetic",
    "description" : "Prior to the IEEE 754 standard, there was no standard for floating point arithmetic. This led to inconsistencies in floating point calculations across different platforms. Portability was a nightmare. The IEEE 754 standard was created to address this issue by providing a standard format for representing floating point numbers and performing arithmetic operations on them. This set of notes will cover the double precision format of IEEE 754.",
