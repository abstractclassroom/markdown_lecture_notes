    "description" : "Counting the number of elements in a set is often very straightforward. However, when the set is infinite, the situation becomes more complicated. In this lesson, we will learn how to count the number of elements in a set, even when the set is infinite. We will also learn about the different sizes of infinite sets, and whether it is appropriate to compare them",
