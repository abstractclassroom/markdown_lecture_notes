    "title" : "Introduction to Quantum Computing",
    "description" : "Quantum computing can be considered a super set of classical computer.  It is a new way of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. This set of notes aims to introduce the mathematical model for quantum computing.",
