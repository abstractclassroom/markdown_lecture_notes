# Mathematical Relations

A human can be related to many different people in many different ways.  Some relations imply a genetic relation to other humans (mother, father, aunt, uncle, cousin, etc).  Other relations may imply a social connection (coworkers, friends, live in same state, etc). Mathematical objects have similar relations that can be arbitrarily defined.

## Representing Relations

A relation is simply a set of ordered pairs that relate mathematical objects to other mathematical objects. The relation can be defined by an equation or some very abstract definition.  Consider the relation $R$ defined below. 

$$R = \{ \left(i,i^2 \right) \; \mid \; i \in \mathbb{N}\}$$
