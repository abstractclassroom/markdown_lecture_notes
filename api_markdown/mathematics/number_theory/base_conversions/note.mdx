# Number Systems & Conversions

Most of the world uses base 10 (decimal) numbers for everyday calculations. However, computers use binary (base 2) numbers for processing data. Occasionally, humans and computers utilize base 16 (hexadecimal) to represent data such as cryptographic hashes. Historically, other cultures and civilizations have used other number systems, such as the Mayan civilization's base 20 system or the Babylonian base 60 system.

## Symbols

There are a few subtle differences in how numbers are represented in different number systems.  Essentially each digit of the base is referred to as a symbol.  For example, in base 10, the symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  In base 2, the symbols are 0 and 1.   Below is a list of symbols for bases 2, 8, 10, and 16:

- Base 2 (Binary): 0, 1
- Base 8 (Octal): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Base 10 (Decimal): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Base 16 (Hexadecimal): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

Notice that the base 2, base 8, and base 10 all use familiar symbols.  However, base 16 uses the letters A-F to represent the numbers 10-15.  This is simply to help avoid confusion between numbers like 10 and A in base 16.

## Notation

When writing numbers in different bases, it is common to use a subscript to indicate the base.  For example, the number 1010 in base 2 would be written as $1010_2$.  The subscript indicates that the number is in base 2.  Similarly, the number 1010 in base 10 would be written as $1010_{10}$.
