# Greatest Common Divisor 

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the larger number that divides both numbers. Consider the set $D_{24}$ which  represents all numbers that evenly divide the number 24.

$D_{24} = \{1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\}$

Now similarly consider $D_{36}$ defined to be the set of numbers that evenly divide 36.

$D_{36} = \{1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36\}$

The greatest commond divisor of 24 and 36 is the number 12 because it is the largest divisor common to both numbers. This can be denoted as shown below.

$GCD(24,36) = 12$

# Least Common Multiple 

The least common multiple (LCM) is also a frequently used tool in number theory and applications. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. Consider the multiples of 24 and 36 below represented by the sets $M_{24}$ and $M{36}$. 

$
\begin{align}
M_{24} &= \{ 1\cdot 24, 2\cdot 24, 3\cdot 24, 4 \cdot 24, ...\} = \{24,48,72,96,...\} \\
M_{36} &= \{ 1 \cdot 36, 2\cdot 36, 3 \cdot 36, 4\cdot 36,...\} = \{36,72,108,144, ...\}
\end{align}
$

The smallest number that is common to both sets is the number 72.  The least common multiple of 24 and 36 is 72 and is denoted below.

$LCM(24,36) = 72$

## Using Prime Factoriztion

Calculating the LCM and GCD of small values is not very difficult.  However, calculating those values for very large numbers may require other methods.  Prime factorization provides a generalization that can be extended other mathematical structures.  

Consider the prime factored form of 24 and 36 shown below.

$$
\begin{align}
24 &= 2^3 \cdot 3 \\
36 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^2
\end{align}
$$

Notice the prime factored form of the LCD and GCD of these two numbers.

$$
\begin{align}
LCM(24,36) &= 72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2\\
GCD(24,36) &= 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3
\end{align}
$$

Notice that both numbers share the same common prime factored base values. The LCM uses the instance with the largest exponent and the GDC uses the instance with the smallest exponent for each prime base.


Let us consider a bigger example.  Consider the two values $a$ and $b$ below in prime factored form. Notice that both are probably larger than the number of atoms in the visible universe.

$$
\begin{align}
a &= 2^{35} \cdot 5^{97} \cdot 11^{45} \cdot 17 \cdot 23^{123} \\
b &= 2 \cdot 3^{22} \cdot 5^{101} \cdot 13^{34} \cdot 17^{2} \cdot 29^{19}
\end{align}
$$

The values do not fully share common prime base values (e.g. $b$ has prime base 3 but $a$ does not).  That is fine because we can put in placeholders using a zero exponent (e.g. $3^0 = 1$).  Rewriting the values with placeholders give the factorization below. 

$$
\begin{align}
a &= 2^{35} \cdot 3^0    \cdot 5^{97}  \cdot 11^{45} \cdot 13^0    \cdot 17     \cdot 23^{123} \\
b &= 2      \cdot 3^{22} \cdot 5^{101} \cdot 11^0    \cdot 13^{34} \cdot 17^{2} \cdot 23^0     \cdot 29^{19}
\end{align}
$$

Putting this in tabular form demonstrating the maximum and minimum exponent for each prime base gives the result below.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\text{Number} & \text{2} & \text{3} & \text{5} & \text{11} & \text{13} & \text{17} & \text{23} & \text{29} \\
\hline
a & 35 & 0 & 97 & 45 & 0 & 1 & 123 & 0 \\
b & 1 & 22 & 101 & 0 & 34 & 2 & 0 & 19 \\
\hline
\text{Max Exponent} & 35 & 22 & 101 & 45 & 34 & 2 & 123 & 19 \\
\text{Min Exponent} & 1 & 0 & 97 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
$$

The LCM of the two values will use the prime bases and the maximum exponent.  The GCD of the two values will use the prime bases and the minimum exponent.  

$$
\begin{align}
GCD(a,b) &= 2^{1} \cdot 3^0    \cdot 5^{97}  \cdot 11^{0} \cdot 13^0    \cdot 17^1     \cdot 23^{0} \cdot 29^0 \\
LCM(a,b) &= 2^{35} \cdot 3^{22}    \cdot 5^{101}  \cdot 11^{45} \cdot 13^{34}    \cdot 17^2     \cdot 23^{123} \cdot 29^{19}
\end{align}
$$

Values with an exponent of zero can be removed. Values with an exponent of 1 can be rewritten without an exponent. The following is the simplified form.  Notice the GCM and LCM values are in prime factored form.

$$
\begin{align}
GCD(a,b) &= 2    \cdot 5^{97}   \cdot 17  \\
LCM(a,b) &= 2^{35} \cdot 3^{22}    \cdot 5^{101}  \cdot 11^{45} \cdot 13^{34}    \cdot 17^2     \cdot 23^{123} \cdot 29^{19}
\end{align}
$$

Both values above are too large to simply construct an exhaustive table to calculate.  This method makes it easy for LCM and GCD to be implemented in computer code.

## LCM & GCD Relationship

The prime factorization method of calculating GCD and LCM also provides some insight into the relationship between LCM and GCD.   Notice that in each case we are either considering the maximum exponent or the minimum exponent.  Notice that multiplying the GCD and LCM of two values is effectively creating a value that adds the exponents (min and max) for each prime base. This is effectively the same thing as multiplying the two values.   This is summarized below. Let $a$ and $b$ be two natural numbers. 

$GCD(a,b) \cdot LCM(a,b) = a \cdot b$

The expression above implies the expressions below. 

$$
\begin{align}
&GCD(a,b) \cdot LCM(a,b) = a \cdot b \\\\
&LCM(a,b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{GCD(a,b)} \\\\
&GCD(a,b) = \frac{a \cdot b} {LCM(a,b)}
\end{align}
$$

There are other algebraic expressions that can be created using GCD and LCM but the above ones are the most common.

## GCD Applications 

GCD is often used as a tool for simplifying expressions.  In the most trivial case it is used to simplify rational numbers.  Consider the fraction below.

$\frac{15}{21}$

Notice that $GCD(15,21) = 3$.  This is the value that must be divided by to simplify the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction. 

$\frac{15}{21} = \frac{3 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 7} = \frac{3}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{5}{7}$

The above is a relatively trivial example that may not be very exciting. Let us consider a more involved example.


Suppose Samantha is preparing for a neighborhood activity where she plans to distribute candy to children.  She has 400 candy suckers and 320 chocolate bars.  The kids in the neighborhood are not well-behaved.  To avoid a child throwing a tantrum she has to make sure every child gets the same number of suckers and chocolate bars.   The GCD of the two values will be the maximum number of children she can distribute the candy equally.

$GCD(400,320) = 80$

Notice the following values. 

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{400}{80} &= 5 \\\\
\frac{320}{80} &= 4
\end{align}
$$

Samantha can give 80 children each exactly 5 suckers and 4 chocolate bars.  If 80 children show up for the activity she will have distributed all suckers and chocolate bars providing each child with the same distribution of candy. 

Examples of equal distribution is a common calculation is distributed computing environments.

## LCM Application 

LCM is often a tool used when looking to calculate equivalences.  Consider addition expression involving two fractions shown below. 
$$\frac{31}{450} + \frac{79}{1250}$$

In order to add the two fractions we must calculate a common denominator.  The smallest common denominator is the LCM of the denominators. 

$$LCM(450,1250) = 11250$$

Notice the following values 

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{11250}{450} &= 25 \\\\
\frac{11250}{1250} &= 9
\end{align}
$$

Converting the fractions to equivalent representations gives a common denominator 

$\frac{31}{450} \cdot \frac{25}{25} + \frac{79}{1250} \cdot \frac{9}{9} = \frac{775}{11250} + \frac{1975}{11250}$

The above is a trivial example. Let us consider a more involved example. Suppose a small gear is used to turn a larger gear.  The small gear has 224 teeth and the larger one has 320 teeth. Once installed a dot is painted on each gear.  The two dots are side by side.  As the gears start turning, the small gear turns faster than the larger.  How many rotations will be required for the two dots to align again? 

$LCM(224,320) = 2240$

Notice the two values below.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{2240}{224} &= 10 \\\\
\frac{2240}{320} &= 7
\end{align}
$$

When the small gear has completed 10 rotations, the large gear will have turned 7 full rotations. At that point the two dots will be aligned again. 

LCM is often used in abstract mathematics to calculate the order of elements in a group (how many times an operation is applied to a single element before the identity is realized).
