# Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations involving the same variables. The solutions to these systems are the values of the variables that satisfy all equations in the system simultaneously.  Linear equations having more than one variable will often have infinitely many solutions, or no solution at all. Each linear equation in a system of equations will have its own set of solution (infinitely many solutions or no solution at all), the solution to the system of equations is the intersection of all the individual solutions.

## Representation

A system of linear equations is often represented using one large bracket, with each equation written in a row. For example, consider the two equations below.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x + 3y &= 6 \\
4x - y &= 5
\end{align*}
$$

A mathematician can indicate that these two equations form a system using the notation below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

The above indicates that the two equations are part of a system, and the solution to the system is the set of values for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

## Solutions 

Consider the system of equations below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

All solutions can be represented as ordered pairs \((x, y)\).  

* The first equation has infinitely many solutions and a few are listed below.
  * $(0, 2)$
  * $(3, 0)$
  * $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$
* The second equation also has infinitely many solutions and a few are listed below.
  * $(0, -5)$
  * $(2, 3)$
  * $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$
* The solution to the system of equations is the intersection of the two sets of solutions, which is the ordered pair $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$. This means that $x=\frac{3}{2}$  and $y=1$ is the only solution that satisfies both equations simultaneously.

### Graphical Representation

The word linear has a very specific meaning in mathematics with respect to equations and a particular dimension.

* The solution to an equation in one variable is a point on a number line.
* The solution to an equation in two variables is line on a Cartesian plane.
* The solution to an equation in three variables is a plane in three-dimensional space.
* The solution to an equation in four or more variables is a hyperplane in higher-dimensional space.

The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is the intersection of two lines on a Cartesian plane. The figure below shows the intersection of the two lines used in the example above.

* The blue line represents the first equation $2x + 3y = 6$.
* The red line represents the second equation $4x - y = 5$.
* The intersection of the two lines is the point $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$, which is the solution to the system of equations.

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations

There are several methods to solve systems of linear equations.  The list below is just a few of the most common methods.
* **Graphical Method**: Plotting the equations on a graph and identifying the intersection point(s).
  * This method is useful for visualizing the solution but may not be precise for complex systems.
  * This method is best suited for systems with two variables.

  * It can be computationally intensive for large systems.
  * It is not commonly used in practice due to its complexity and inefficiency compared to other methods.
  * Implementations are typically oriented toward theoretical applications or proofs rather than practical computation.

## Substitution Method Example

This example demonstrates the substitution method for solving a system of linear equations.

Consider the system of equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

To solve this system using the substitution method, we can follow these steps:

1. **Solve one equation for one variable**: The variable $y$ appears to be easier to isolate in the second equation. We can rearrange the second equation to express $y$ in terms of $x$:
   $$
   4x - y = 5 \implies y = 4x - 5
   $$
2. **Substitute the expression into the other equation**: Now, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation:
    $$ 2x + 3\underbrace{(4x - 5)}_{y} = 6 $$
3. **Simplify and solve for $x$**:  Notice the substitution has created a single equation in terms of $x$:
   $$
   2x + 12x - 15 = 6 \implies 14x - 15 = 6 \implies 14x = 21 \implies x = \frac{3}{2}
   $$
4. **Substitute back to find $y$**: Now that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $y$:
   $$
   y = 4\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
   $$
5. **Final solution**: The solution to the system of equations is:
   $$
   \left( x, y \right) = \left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)
   $$

This means that the values $x = \frac{3}{2}$ and $y = 1$ satisfy both equations in the system.

## Substitution Method Three Variable Example

This example demonstrates the substitution method for solving a system of linear equations with three variables.
Consider the system of equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x + 2y + 3z = 9 \\
2x - y + z = 4 \\
3x + 4y - z = 2
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

To solve this system using the substitution method, we can follow these steps:
1. **Solve one equation for one variable**: The first equation appears to be the simplest to isolate a variable. We can rearrange it to express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$:
   $$
   x = 9 - 2y - 3z
   $$
2. **Substitute the expression into the other equations**: Now, we can substitute this expression for $x$ into the second and third equations:
   - For the second equation:
   $$
   2(9 - 2y - 3z) - y + z = 4 \implies 18 - 4y - 6z - y + z = 4 \implies -5y - 5z = -14 \implies y + z = \frac{14}{5}
   $$
   - For the third equation:
   $$
   3(9 - 2y - 3z) + 4y - z = 2 \implies 27 - 6y - 9z + 4y - z = 2 \implies -2y - 10z = -25 \implies y + 5z = \frac{25}{2}
   $$
3. **Now we have a new system of equations**:
$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
y + z = \frac{14}{5} \\
y + 5z = \frac{25}{2}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$      
4. **Solve the new system**: We can solve this new system for $y$ and $z$. From the first equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $z$:
   $$
   y = \frac{14}{5} - z
   $$
   Now substitute this into the second equation:
   $$
   \left(\frac{14}{5} - z\right) + 5z = \frac{25}{2}
   $$
   Simplifying this gives:
   $$
   \frac{14}{5} + 4z = \frac{25}{2}
   $$
   To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply through by 10 (the least common multiple of 5 and 2):
   $$
   28 + 40z = 125 \implies 40z = 97 \implies z = \frac{97}{40}
   $$
5. **Substitute back to find $y$**: Now that we have the value of $z$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $y$:
   $$
   y = \frac{14}{5} - \frac{97}{40} = \frac{112 - 97}{40} = \frac{15}{40} = \frac{3}{8}
   $$
6. **Substitute back to find $x$**: Now that we have the values of $y$ and $z$, we can substitute them back into the expression for $x$:
   $$
   x = 9 - 2\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) - 3\left(\frac{97}{40}\right) = 9 - \frac{6}{8} - \frac{291}{40} = 9 - \frac{3}{4} - \frac{291}{40}
   $$
   To combine these, we can convert 9 to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
   $$
   x = \frac{360}{40} - \frac{30}{40} - \frac{291}{40} = \frac{360 - 30 - 291}{40} = \frac{39}{40}
   $$
7. **Final solution**: The solution to the system of equations is:
   $$
   \left( x, y, z \right) = \left( \frac{39}{40}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{97}{40} \right)
   $$

Notice that as the number of variables increases, the complexity of the substitution method also increases. For systems with more than three variables, it is often more efficient to use matrix methods or elimination methods. These methods will be demonstrated in other lecture notes.
