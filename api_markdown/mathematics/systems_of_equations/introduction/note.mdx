# Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations involving the same variables. The solutions to these systems are the values of the variables that satisfy all equations in the system simultaneously.  Linear equations having more than one variable will often have infinitely many solutions, or no solution at all. Each linear equation in a system of equations will have its own set of solution (infinitely many solutions or no solution at all), the solution to the system of equations is the intersection of all the individual solutions.

## Representation

A system of linear equations is often represented using one large bracket, with each equation written in a row. For example, consider the two equations below.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x + 3y &= 6 \\
4x - y &= 5
\end{align*}
$$

A mathematician can indicate that these two equations form a system using the notation below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

The above indicates that the two equations are part of a system, and the solution to the system is the set of values for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

## Solutions 

Consider the system of equations below.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$

All solutions can be represented as ordered pairs \((x, y)\).  

* The first equation has infinitely many solutions and a few are listed below.
  * $(0, 2)$
  * $(3, 0)$
  * $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$
* The second equation also has infinitely many solutions and a few are listed below.
  * $(0, -5)$
  * $(2, 3)$
  * $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$
* The solution to the system of equations is the intersection of the two sets of solutions, which is the ordered pair $\left( \frac{3}{2}, 1 \right)$. This means that $x=\frac{3}{2}$  and $y=1$ is the only solution that satisfies both equations simultaneously.

### Graphical Representation

The word linear has a very specific meaning in mathematics with respect to equations and a particular dimension.

* The solution to an equation in one variable is a point on a number line.
* The solution to an equation in two variables is line on a Cartesian plane.
* The solution to an equation in three variables is a plane in three-dimensional space.
* The solution to an equation in four or more variables is a hyperplane in higher-dimensional space.

The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is the intersection of two lines on a Cartesian plane. The figure below shows the intersection of the two lines used in the example above.
