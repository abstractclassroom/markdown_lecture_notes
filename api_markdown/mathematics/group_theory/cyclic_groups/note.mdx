# Cyclic Groups

Groups that are generated by a single element are called **cyclic groups**.  A cyclic group with $n$ elements is denoted $C_n$.  More to the point, a cyclic group of order $n$ will be called **the** cyclic group of order $n$ because all cyclic groups of a given order are **isomorphic**. 

## Example Of a Cyclic Group

Consider the group of integers modulo $n$ under addition, denoted $\mathbb{Z}_n$.  This group is cyclic because it can be generated by the element $1$.  In other words, every element of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ can be written as a multiple of $1$ modulo $n$. Specifically, consider $\mathbb{Z}_5$ and notice that all elements can be generated using only the element $1$.

$$
\begin{align}
1 & = 1 \\
2 & = 1 + 1 \\
3 & = 1 + 1 + 1 \\
4 & = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\
0 & = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
\end{align}
$$

To be clear, there are other generators of $\mathbb{Z}_5$.  For example, $2$ is also a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_5$ because every element can be written as a multiple of $2$ modulo $5$.

$$
\begin{align}
2 & = 2 \\
4 & = 2 + 2 \\
1 & = 2 + 2 + 2 \\
3 & = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 \\
0 & = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
\end{align}
$$

There is no requirement for there to be multiple generators. A cyclic group may have only one generator.

## Generator Notation

As mentioned above, the notation for a cyclic group of order $n$ is $C_n$.  The generator $g$ of a cyclic group is denoted $\langle g \rangle$.  The notation below is used to denote the cyclic group $C_n$ is generated by element $g$.
$$\langle g \rangle = C_n$$

## Isomorphic Relationships

As stated, all cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic.  Fortunately, all cyclic groups are isomorphic to a class of groups that are relatively easy to work with and understand. \\\\

Since $\mathbb{Z}_n = \langle 1 \rangle$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can say that $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is isomorphic to $C_n$.  The notation below is used to denote this isomorphism.
$$\mathbb{Z}_n \cong C_n$$

This is very important because cyclic groups are commonly used in group theory and number theory. The isomorphic relationship between $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $C_n$ provides a way to work with cyclic groups using the familiar properties of integers modulo $n$ under addition.

## Generators - Number Theory

Identifying all the generators of a cyclic groups is one example where analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ can be useful.  The generators of a cyclic group $C_n$ are the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.  In other words, the generators of $C_n$ are the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that have a greatest common divisor of $1$ with $n$.  \\\\

### Euler's Totient Function

Euler's totient function, denoted $\phi(n)$, is the number of integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.  As a result, the number of generators of a cyclic group $C_n$ is $\phi(n)$.  The formula for Euler's totient function is given below.
$$
\phi(n) = n \prod_{p \mid n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)   \text{ where } p \text{ is prime}   
$$

### Generator Example  

Below are some examples of the generators  of cyclic groups.  

$$
\begin{align}
C_2 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle}_{\phi(2) = 1} \\
C_3 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle}_{\phi(3) = 2} \\
C_4 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle}_{\phi(4) = 2} \\
C_5 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle}_{\phi(5) = 4} \\
C_6 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle}_{\phi(6) = 2} \\
C_7 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 6 \rangle}_{\phi(7) = 6} \\
C_8 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle}_{\phi(8) = 4} \\
C_9 & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle = \langle 8 \rangle}_{\phi(9) = 6} \\
C_{10} & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle = \langle 9 \rangle}_{\phi(10) = 4} \\
C_{11} & = \underbrace{\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 6 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle = \langle 8 \rangle = \langle 9 \rangle = \langle 10 \rangle}_{\phi(11) = 10} \\
\end{align}
$$

Notice that when $n$ is prime, $\phi(n) = n - 1$.  This means that all elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are generators of $C_n$ when $n$ is prime.  This is a very important property of cyclic groups.

## Conclusion 

Cyclic groups are fundamental in group theory and number theory.  They are easy to work with and understand because they can be generated by a single element.  The isomorphic relationship between $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $C_n$ provides a way to work with cyclic groups using the familiar properties of integers modulo $n$ under addition.  Identifying the generators of a cyclic group is an important concept in number theory, and Euler's totient function provides a way to calculate the number of generators of a cyclic group.
