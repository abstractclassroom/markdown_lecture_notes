# Binomial Coefficients

The binomial coefficient is a mathematical concept used to calculate the number of subsets of a given size that can be formed from a larger set. A fundamental property of sets is that they do not contain duplicates, and the order of elements does not matter. Binomial coefficients are central to combinatorics and appear in various applications such as probability, algebra, and number theory.

## Notation and Formula

The binomial coefficient is commonly denoted as:

$$
\binom{n}{k}
$$

This represents the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. It is read as "n choose k." The formula for calculating binomial coefficients is:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

Where:
- $n!$ is the factorial of $n$ (the product of all positive integers up to $n$).
- $k!$ is the factorial of $k$.
- $(n-k)!$ is the factorial of $n-k$.

## Recursion Formula

The binomial coefficient satisfies the following recursive relationship:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}
$$

### Explanation:
- The term $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ represents the subsets that include a specific element.
- The term $\binom{n-1}{k}$ represents the subsets that do not include that specific element.

This recursion forms the basis of Pascal's Triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it.

## Binomial Polynomial Expansion

Binomial coefficients play a key role in expanding powers of binomials using the Binomial Theorem:

$$
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
$$

### Explanation:
- $n$ is the power to which the binomial $(a + b)$ is raised.
- $\binom{n}{k}$ determines the coefficient for the term $a^{n-k}b^k$.
- The summation iterates over all possible values of $k$, from $0$ to $n$.

### Example:
For $(a + b)^3$, using the Binomial Theorem:

$$
(a + b)^3 = \binom{3}{0}a^3b^0 + \binom{3}{1}a^2b^1 + \binom{3}{2}a^1b^2 + \binom{3}{3}a^0b^3
$$

$$
(a + b)^3 = 1a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 1b^3
$$

## Symmetry of Binomial Coefficients

Binomial coefficients exhibit an important symmetry property, which reflects the way subsets can be chosen in reverse order. This symmetry is expressed as:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}
$$

The symmetry arises because choosing $k$ elements from a set of $n$ is equivalent to excluding $n-k$ elements from the same set. Both operations result in the same subset configuration.

### Example:
Consider $n = 5$ and $k = 2$:

$$
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
$$

notice the following equivalent calculation for $k = 3$:

$$
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
$$

As a result we have the result below.

$$
\binom{5}{2} = \binom{5}{3}
$$

### Symmetry in Pascal's Triangle

This symmetry is also evident in Pascal's Triangle, where the entries on opposite sides of the triangle are equal. For example, the third row of Pascalâ€™s Triangle is:

$$
1, 3, 3, 1
$$

Here, $\binom{3}{1} = \binom{3}{2} = 3$, demonstrating the symmetry.

### Implications of Symmetry

1. **Simplification of Calculations**:
   When calculating binomial coefficients, symmetry can reduce the complexity by allowing the use of the smaller of $k$ or $n-k$.

2. **Polynomial Expansions**:
   In binomial expansions, the terms in the first half mirror those in the second half due to this symmetry. For example:

   $$
   (a + b)^4 = \binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \binom{4}{4}a^0b^4
   $$

   The coefficients:
   $$
   1, 4, 6, 4, 1
   $$
   are symmetric.

The symmetry of binomial coefficients is a foundational property that simplifies combinatorial reasoning and enhances understanding of polynomial expansions.
