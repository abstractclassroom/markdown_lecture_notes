# Famous Infinite Sets 

Mathematical publications are filled with references to well-known sets. These sets are referenced so often they are given their own symbol and name.  

## Real Numbers
Real numbers are denoted using the symbol $\mathbb{R}$. These are **all** the values that do not have an imaginary component (traditional values).
* **Natural Numbers** 
    * $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
    * When counting objects, people often start with the number 1 as a **natural** way of counting. Recall that sets do not have an order but are often arranged in an order to demonstrate a pattern associated with the elements. Notice the smallest element in this set is the value 1.
    * Countably infinite set.
* **Whole Numbers**
    * $\mathbb{W} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
    * Countably infinite set.
* **Integers**
    * $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$
    * Notice this set continues to infinity in both directions.
    * Countably infinite set.
* **Rationals**
    * $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{\frac{a}{b} \; \middle| \; a, b \in  \mathbb{Z}, \; b \neq 0 \right\}$
    * Roster form would be cumbersome. Set-builder form is used because the elements of the rationals are essentially constructed.  
    * This set consists of all values that are the fraction of two integers (nonzero denominator).
    * Their decimal expanded form either terminates or forms a repeating pattern.
        * $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$ (terminates)
        * $\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}$ (forms repeating pattern)
    * Examples: $-\frac{8}{5} = \frac{-8}{5} \in \mathbb{Q}$, $4 = \frac{4}{1} \in \mathbb{Q}$.
    * Countably infinite set.
* **Irrationals**
    * $\mathbb{Q}^c$
    * These are essentially all the real numbers that are **not** rational (irrational).  
    * The definition of the rationals is enough to create the symbol for the irrationals. (Complement of the rationals)
    * Their decimal expansion is an infinite string of numbers that never form a repeating pattern ($\pi = 3.141592\ldots$).
    * Examples: $\pi \in \mathbb{Q}^c$, $e \in \mathbb{Q}^c$ (Euler's constant).
    * Uncountably infinite set.
* **Real Numbers**
    * $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{Q}^c$
    * Every real number is either rational or irrational (not both). However, some values have not been determined which category they belong to. 
        * It is not known whether $e \cdot \pi$ is rational or irrational. 
        * It is not known whether $e + \pi$ is rational or irrational. 
            * It is known that at least one of the above is irrational because it can be demonstrated they both cannot be rational.

## Complex Numbers 

At one point in human history, the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ would have been described as erroneous with no solution. If we limit our domain to real numbers, the equation has no solution. However, thanks to a 1500s mathematician named Gerolamo Cardano, we know the real numbers are not everything. The **complex numbers** are an important set of numbers. Real analysis is a field of mathematical research that deals with the set of real numbers (e.g., differential equations). Complex analysis is a field of mathematical research that broadens the domain to include a superset of the real numbers called the **complex numbers**. There are several examples where complex analysis is required to analyze problems with **real** valued solutions (e.g., winding number - integrals).

The history of **complex** analysis is very interesting and even entails the mathematician and artist Ren√© Descartes.

Below is the symbol and set-builder notation for complex numbers:

$$\mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi \; \mid \; a, b \in \mathbb{R} \}$$

Every complex number has a real component and an imaginary component. 

Consider the complex value $z = 3 + 5i$. The real part is $\Re(z) = 3$ and the imaginary part is $\Im(z) = 5$. To offer clarification, you may recall from algebra the imaginary unit. The imaginary unit $i$ is defined to be the solution to the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$. 

Every real number is a complex number having a zero imaginary part.  

$7 = 7 + 0i$.  

Numbers with a zero real part are called imaginary numbers.

$2i = 0 + 2i$

In general, every number has a real part and an imaginary part (even if it is zero), and so the complex numbers represent the broadest set of numbers used in analysis.

### Subset Chain Observation

Notice the following subset chain:

$\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{W} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$

Any set that is to the left of another set is an implied subset. 

$\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{R}$ 

Here is another subset chain associated with irrational numbers: 

$\mathbb{Q}^c \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$

## Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers  

The set of algebraic numbers is the set of numbers that are the root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with integer coefficients.  

Consider the polynomial $x + 1$. Since $x + 1 = 0$ implies $-1$ is a root of the polynomial (solutions when polynomial is set equal to zero). 

Below are some properties associated with algebraic numbers:

* All rational numbers are algebraic. 
* All rational numbers raised to a rational power are algebraic ($a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[m]{a^n}$).
    * The golden ratio $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is algebraic. 
    * $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic.
* The set of algebraic numbers is countably infinite.
* Algebraic numbers are closed under the traditional operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

The transcendental numbers are the complement to the algebraic numbers and include numbers like $\pi$ and $e$.   

Below are some properties of transcendental numbers:

* All transcendental numbers are irrational. 
    * Not all irrational numbers are transcendental (e.g., $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and algebraic).
* The set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite. 
* The set of transcendental numbers is not closed under the traditional operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

The Wikipedia page on transcendental numbers provides a good historical context on some of the surprising facts associated with algebraic and transcendental numbers.

## Prime Numbers 

The variables $p$ and $q$ are often commonly used to represent arbitrary prime numbers. Be careful defining this set to be the numbers that are divisible only by one and itself. That definition can incorrectly include the number 1. There are instances where theorems involving primes will work when considering the number 1. However, those instances often allow prime powers, and raising a value (prime) to the zero power results in the number 1.

The prime numbers are a countably infinite set. The first few are shown below: 

$\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, \ldots\}$

There is no known pattern or distribution to the prime numbers. Finding a pattern or distribution would be a historical discovery.

## Perfect Squares 

The set of perfect squares is the set of values that are the square of a whole number. 

$$
\begin{align}
\{ x^2 \; \mid \; x \in \mathbb{W} \} &= \{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, \ldots\}\\ 
&= \{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\}
\end{align}
$$

## Conclusion 

Most mathematical properties and theorems only apply to certain domains. Recognizing the well-known sets described above is a good step toward becoming a professional engineer and/or mathematician. There are many other well-known sets, but the sets above provide a good starting point.
