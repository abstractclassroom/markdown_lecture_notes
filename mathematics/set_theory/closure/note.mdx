# Set Cardinality

The **cardinality** of a set is basically the number of elements contained in a set. Symbolically, the cardinality of a set is represented using the absolute value bars. Consider the set $A$ as an example below.

$$A = \{3,-2, 5, 8, 11 , 20\}$$

$$|A| = 6$$

The expression $|A| = 6$ simply means that set $A$ contains 6 elements.

## Empty Set $\emptyset$

There is one set that is surprisingly simple but can very complex implications. The set that contains no elements is referred to as **the empty set**.  

The empty set can be symbolically denoted in two different ways.
1. Modern typesetting fonts make the symbol $\emptyset$ the most common representation of the empty set. 
    * This symbol has an interesting origin.  A rolling group of mathematicians published papers and held conferences under the name **Nicolas Bourbaki**. This group spanned the 1900s having 10-12 active members at a time.  Several popular mathematical symbols originated from this group.
        * Are you familiar with the band T$\emptyset$P (Twenty One Pilots) and noticed the symbol in the band name?  
            * One part of the song **Morph** references Nicolas Bourbaki.  
            * They reference **Nico and the niners**.  
            * Blurryface is a reference to this group of mathematicians. 
2. Older textbooks would often use the symbol $\{ \}$.  This is intuitive because itt looks like a roster form set with nothing inside it.

Obviously, the cardinality of the empty set is zero and is denoted symbolically below.

$$| \emptyset | = 0$$

Be sure to notice the empty set symbol is not the same symbol as the number zero.  Recall that for numbers the absolute value bars indicate how far a value is from zero.  The reason we use absolute value bars to denote set cardinality is that it effectively measures how far a set is from the empty set.

Anytime a set is found to be empty it should be referred to as **the** empty set.  It is a trivial play on the fact sets do not have an order. Two empty sets are essentially equal.  As a result, we claim there is only one empty set.

## Infinite Sets 

A set with a bounded number of elements is called a **finite** set.  However, some sets do not have a bounded number of elements.  The set of whole numbers, represented by the symbol $\mathbb{W}$, has an **infinite** number of elements and so it is called an **infinite** set.

Infinite sets do not have a cardinality and mathematicians use the infinity symbol $\infty$ to denote a nonexistent cardinality.  Consider the whole numbers below as an example.

$$\mathbb{W} = \{0,1,2,3,...\}$$

$$| \mathbb{W} | = \infty$$

## Georg Cantor & Uncountable Sets

Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (concisely known as Georg Cantor) lived from 1845 to 1918 and is credited with the notion of uncountable sets.  **Countable** sets have elements that can be enumerated.  This implies you could assign each element a sequential number. 

* We could put a number on every chair in a stadium.
* Theoretically we could assign a number to every grain of sand on a beach.
* In some cases we can assign a number to every element of an infinite set.
    * Obviously true since the whole numbers are sequential numbers starting at zero.

However, there are some sets that are so dense we could not assign a number to every element (even if we had infinite time).  The most classical case is the set of real numbers. 

Uncountable sets are difficult to comprehend.  Some very famous open mathematical questions involve determining whether a set is countably or uncountably infinite.  Be familiar with the categories below.

* **Finite Sets** 
    * Always countable 
    * Cardinality exists (it is a value)
    * Bounded number of elements 
* **Infinite Sets** 
    * **Countably Infinite** - There are an infinite number of elements in the set and the elements can theoretically be enumerated.
    * **Uncountably Infinite** - There are an infinite number of elements and they are so dense they can not be enumerated.
