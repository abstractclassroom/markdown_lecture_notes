# Binary Set Operations 

In the context of this set of notes, a binary operation takes two sets as inputs and produces a single set as an output.   Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are binary operations on real numbers with dedicated symbols (+, -, etc).  Similarly, set theory also has a common set of binary operations with dedicated symbols.

## Union Of Sets 

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets.  The **union** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A \cup B$ and essentially combines the two sets into a single new set.  Recall that sets do not contain duplicates.  Consider the example below. 

$$A = \{ 1,2,4,8, 7\}$$

$$B = \{ 1,5,8,3,9\}$$

$$A \cup B = \{ 1,2,4,8,7,5,3,9 \}$$

Notice that the union essentially combined the two sets (without creating duplicates per set theory properties).

The union of two sets can be described using set builder notation as shown by the expression below.

$$A \cup B = \{ x \; \mid \; x \in A \; \text{ or } \; x \in B\}$$

## Intersection Of Sets 

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets.  The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A \cap B$ and will result in a set composed of elements that are in **both** $A$ and $B$.  Consider the example below. 

$$A = \{ 1,2,4,8, 7\}$$

$$B = \{ 1,5,8,3,9\}$$

$$A \cap B = \{ 1,8 \}$$


The intersection of two sets can be described using set builder notation as shown by the expression below.

$$A \cap B = \{ x \; \mid \; x \in A \; \text{ and } \; x \in B\}$$

## Difference Of Two Sets

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets.  The **difference** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A - B$ (or $A \backslash B$ ) and will result in a set containing the elements that are only in set $A$. Restated, it will be a set containing the elements of $A$ as long as they are not in set $B$. Consider the example below. 

$$A = \{ 1,2,4,8, 7\}$$

$$B = \{ 1,5,8,3,9\}$$

$$A - B = \{ 2,4,7 \}$$

Notice that $A - B$ are the elements of $A$ except for the numbers 1 and 8 because they were also elements of $B$.


The difference of two sets can be described using set builder notation as shown by the expression below.

$$A - B = \{ x \; \mid \; x \in A \; \text{ and } \; x \notin B\}$$

## Symmetric Difference Of Two Sets

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets.  The **symmetric difference** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted $A \Delta B$ (or $A \ominus B$ ) and will result in a set containing the elements that are in set $A$ **or** $B$ but not in their intersection. Restated, it will be the union of $A$ and $B$ with the intersection removed. Consider the example below. 

$$A = \{ 1,2,4,8, 7\}$$

$$B = \{ 1,5,8,3,9\}$$

$$A \Delta B = \{ 2,4,7,5,3,9 \}$$

Notice that $A \Delta B$ is the union of the two sets except for the numbers 1 and 8 because they are in the intersection of $A$ and $B$.


The symmetric difference of two sets can be described using set builder notation as shown by the expression below.

$$A \Delta B = \{ x \; \mid \; x \in A \cup B \; \text{ and } \; x \notin A \cap B\}$$
