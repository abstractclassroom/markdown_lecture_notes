# Complements & Domains

The complement of a set is essentially everything that is not inside the set. Consider the set below.

$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$

The complement of set $A$ is denoted $A^c$ (or sometimes $A'$). Typically, mathematicians will indicate the notations for set complements to ensure the reader does not confuse the notation with some other mathematical meaning. An object must either be an element of a set or its complement, but not both. As such, the expression below must be true.

$A \cap A^c = \emptyset$

Since $1 \in A$, it must be the case that $1 \notin A^c$. Also, notice that $7 \notin A$, so $7 \in A^c$. This may seem like a simple concept. However, notice that your car is not in set $A$ and therefore would be an element of $A^c$. Suddenly, the notion of the complement of a set becomes somewhat silly. This is where a domain (or universal set) becomes important.

## Domain

Whenever a mathematician declares a set to be a domain, the elements of that domain (set) are the only objects considered relevant for analysis. By limiting the scope, the complement of a set becomes more meaningful. In most cases, mathematicians and engineers should try to establish a domain to avoid discussions about irrelevant edge cases.

Time for an example. Let $D = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\}$ be the domain and $A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$. Since the elements of $D$ are the only objects that can be considered, the complement of $A$ has a much more limited scope.

$A^c = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$

Notice the elements of $A^c$ are all the elements in $D$ that are not in $A$. This definition can be formally expressed in set-builder notation as shown below.

$A^c = \{ x \mid x \in D \text{ and } x \notin A \}$

Notice this can be expressed as a set difference as shown below.

$A^c = D - A$

# Bertrand Russell's Barber Paradox

Bertrand Russell (1872â€“1970) was a logician (a branch of mathematics) known for the famous **Barber Paradox**. The paradox highlights the importance of defining a domain and set membership. This is Bertrand Russell's paradox: The only barber in a village is the one who shaves all those, and only those, who do not shave themselves. Given this definition of a barber, let's consider the contradiction it creates. **Who shaves the barber?**

* If the barber shaves himself, then he is not the barber (contradiction).
* If the barber does not shave himself, then he will be shaved by the barber (contradiction).

Russell's paradox was posed as an easy-to-digest statement to illustrate problems that can arise in set theory if domains and set membership are not defined properly. To analyze this at a deeper level, consider a set $R$ composed of sets (a set containing other sets) that do not contain themselves.

$R = \{ x \mid x \notin x \}$

Obviously, $R$ would contain our simple examples $A$ and $D$. Even though we have not explicitly considered the complement of $R$, we are considering sets that do not contain themselves (implying complements). A natural question then becomes whether $R \in R$. Obviously, if $R \in R$, then by definition $R \notin R$ (contradiction). Conversely, if $R \notin R$, then by definition $R \in R$ (contradiction).

## Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) Set Theory

These types of contradictions led to the development of **Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF)** set theory. ZF set theory establishes a framework for **well-founded** sets that do not allow for paradoxes like the one described above. One of the implied foundations of ZF set theory is that a domain and set membership must be clearly defined in all scenarios. Whether explicitly stated, most mathematical objects are established with ZF set theory being applied.

It is important to note that computer scientists often analyze theoretical objects that do not follow ZF set theory. When considering a set that can contain itself, you can have expressions like the one below.

$A = \{ A \}$

Notice the expression below can create loops as shown below.

$A \rightarrow \{A\} \rightarrow \{\{A\}\} \rightarrow \ldots$

Recognize this type of construction is related to a common programming practice known as recursion.

Admittedly, this goes a bit deep into set theory. However, having a well-rounded knowledge of an academic **domain** is always important. Hopefully, you notice the humor and relevance of the previous sentence.
