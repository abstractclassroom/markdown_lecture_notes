# Subsets

Subsets are a useful but relatively simple concept.  Consider the two sets below.

$$A = \{1,2,3,...,9,10\}$$

$$B = \{2,4,6,8,10\}$$

Notice that every element in set $B$ is also an element of set $A$.  As such, set $B$ is called a **subset** of set $A$. This is denoted symbolically as the expression below.

$$B \subset A$$

This reads as "set $B$ is a subset of set $A$".  Similar to how $3<4$ is equivalent to $4>3$, the subset notation can be flipped as shown below.

$$A \supset B$$

The above expression is not common but is read "set $A$ is a superset of set $B$". 

Mathematicians often need to indicate that a set is not a subset of another set.  Consider the two sets below.

$$S = \{1,5,7,13,25,-9\}$$

$$T = \{1,5,7,12\}$$

Notice the number 12 is an element of set $T$ but not an element of set $S$.  This implies that $T$ is not a subset of $S$ and is denoted symbolically below.

$$T \not\subset S$$

A slash through a mathematical symbol typicall appends the word "not" to negate the traditional meaning of the symbol.

## Trivial Subsets 

Every subset has two automatic subsets, specifically the set itself and the empty set.   Suppose set $A$ is a set.  The two expressions below are true.

$$ \emptyset \subset A$$ 

$$ A \subset A$$

Obviously every element of set $A$ is an element of set $A$.  So it is not surprising that a set is automatically a subset of itself.  The case where the empty set is a subset may be less clear.  

The empty set being an automatic subset is an example of a **vacuously true** statement.  This deserves an explanation.

#### **Proof** : The Empty Set Is Always A Subset 

Let $A$ be a set of objects.  The expression $\emptyset \subset A$ must be true or false.  Claiming the statement is true may feel awkward and hard to prove directly.   So let us consider the alternative. Suppose the expression $\emptyset \subset A$ is false.  This would imply the empty set contains something that is not in set $A$.  However, that is a contradiction because the empty set is empty by definiton.  Clearly, the expression $\emptyset \subset A$ can not be false because that leads to a contradiction. It must be the case that $\emptyset \subset A$ is a true statement. Given the arbitrary way we defined set $A$, it must be the case that the empty set is always a subset. 

It is worth noting a very important logical fact: **A true statement is a statement that can not lead to a contradiction**.   Whenever a statement is true simply because the alternative creates a contradiction the statement is said to be **vaciously true**.  Simply stated, it is true because the alternative is problematic.

## Proper Subsets 

A mathematician may want to clearly indicate a subset is not empty and not equivalent to the set itself.  Simply stated, a mathematician may want to indicate a subset is not a trivial subset.  Suppose set $B$ is a subset of $A$ and $B$ is not a trivial subset of $A$.  

* To demonstrate the set is nonempty (use cardinality symbol)
    * $|B| > 0$
* To demonstrate $B$ is not equivalent to $A$ (two options)
    * $B \subsetneq A$ (notice the slash through the equality line)
    * $B \neq A$ (Probably more clear and noticeable)

Without proper clarification the expression $B \subset A$ would certainly imply $B$ could be a trivial subset of $A$.

## Relationship To Cardinality 

Obviously a subset can not be larger than the superset.   Assume $A$ and $B$ are sets where $B\subset A$.  The following must be true.

$$|B| \leq |A|$$

A subset of an infinite set may be finite or infinite.  Consider the following set. 

$$\underbrace{\mathbb{W} = \{ 0,1,2,3,...\}}_{\text{Infinite Set}}$$ 

$$\underbrace{A = \{2,4,6,8,...\}}_{\text{Infinite Set}} \subset \mathbb{W}$$ 

$$\underbrace{B = \{2,4\}}_{\text{Finite Set}} \subset \mathbb{W}$$ 

Notice that $A \subset \mathbb{W}$ and $|A| = \infty$.  Also notice that $B \subset \mathbb{W}$ and $|B| = 2$.

Below are some facts associated with cardinality and subsets. 
 * A subset of a countable set (finite or infinite) must also be countable.  
 * An uncountably infinite set can have finite, uncountably infintie, and countably infinite subsets. 
 * If $A \subset B$ then $|A| \leq |B|$.
 * If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$ then $A=B$.
 * A subset of a finite set must also be finite.
 * Suppose $A \subset B$ where $A$ is a finite set and $B$ is an infinite set.  The expression $|A| < |B|$ is acceptable.
 * It is never appropriate to compare  the cardinalities (e.g. $<$, $>$, $=$, etc) of two infinite sets. Surprising relationships can happen between two infinite sets.  
 * The notions of countable and uncountable infinite sets are part of an advanced field of mathematics called measure theory. 
    * In general, be careful about comparing infinite sets (countable or uncountable).
    * Strange and nonintuitive relationships can occur with infinite sets. 
    * Infinite sets do not have a cardinality. Be careful about drawing conclusions between countable and uncountable sets beyond being able to enumerate (index) elements of a set.

## Power Sets

In some instances it may be necessary to consider a set and all possible subsets of the set.  Consider the set below.

$$A = \{1,2,3,4\}$$

The **power set** of $A$, denoted $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is a set consisting of all possible subsets of $A$ (including the trivial ones).

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ \;\; & \\
& \emptyset, \\
& \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}, \\
& \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{1,4\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\}, \\
& \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{2,3,4\}, \\
& A \\
\}
\end{align}
$$

The power set is a set that contains other sets (namely all subsets of $A$). The power set elements are displayed on multiple lines to help with readability.

 Consider the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(A)$.

$$ | \mathcal{P}(A) | = 16$$

You may notice that 16 is a power of 2, specifically $16=2^4$.  It is not coincidental that $|A| = 4$.  In general, the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(B)$ is simply two raised to the number of elements in set $B$.  This is formally represented by the expression below.

$$| \mathcal{P}(A) | = 2^{|A|}$$
