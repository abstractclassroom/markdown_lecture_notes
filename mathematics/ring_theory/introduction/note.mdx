# Ring Theory 

At a very young age people are taught that we can add and multiply numbers.  Notice that we also add and multiply matrices.  We can also add and multiply polynomials.  Ring theory establishes the basis for how we can overload the operations of $+$ and $\cdot$ so they can be applied to very abstract objects.

A ring $R$ is a set with two well-defined operations that have very specific properties.  A ring is often denoted as $R(+,\cdot)$ and has the following properties.

* A ring is a set with two operations defined on the elements $+$ and $\cdot$
* Under $+$ the ring forms an abelian group. 
* The operation $\cdot$ must have the following properties 
    * Closure ( $a,b \in R$ then $a\cdot b \in R$)
    * There must be a multiplicative identity ( $a \cdot I = I \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in R$)
    * Must be associative. ( $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a,b,c \in R$)
    * There is no requirement for multiplicative inverses.  
* The operation $\cdot$ must distribute over $+$.   ($a \cdot (b +c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ for all $a,b,c \in R$ )

Any structure that requires both addition and multiplication (matrices, polynomials, etc) will implement some form of ring.

Typically the additive identity (identity under the operation of $+$) is denoted as $0$.  The multiplicative identity (identity under the operation of $\cdot$ is denoted as $1$).

## Classic Rings 

Below are some examles of classical rings 

* $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring under the traditional operations of addition and multiplication.
* $\mathbb{R}$ is a ring under the traditional operations of addition and multiplication.
* $\mathbb{Q}$ is a ring under the traditional operations of addition and multiplication.
* $\mathbb{C}$ is a ring under the traditional operations of addition and multiplication.

Notice there is not requirement for the operation $\cdot$ to have inverses.  This allows sets containing zero to be rings (zero has no multiplicative inverse ).

## Matrix Rings

Square matrices can be added and multiplied. In order to perform matrix addition and multiplication, the elements need to be added and multiplied.  Traditionally, the elements of a matrix are values.  However, the elements of a matrix can be any object that belongs to a ring.  This is a very powerful concept.  This means the elements of a matrix can be other matrices, polynomials, or numbers as long as the elements belong to a ring.  

Matrices whose elements are from a ring will also form a new matrix ring.

It is important to become familiar with ring notation. 

* $M_4(\mathbb{Z})$ - This is a ring of $4\times4$ matrices whose elements are from the ring of integers. 
* $M_8(\mathbb{R})$ - This is a ring of $8 \times 8$ matrices whose elements are from the ring of real numbers.

## Polynomial Rings 

Similar to matrices, polynomials are structures that can be used to form new rings using other rings.  

If the coefficients of a set of polynomials are from a common ring, the set of polynomials will also be a ring.

* $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the ring of polynomials whose coefficients are from the ring of integers.
* $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is the ring of polynomials whose coefficients are from the ring of real numbers.

## Complicated structures 

Rings structures can become quite complex.  Consider some of the examples below.

* $M_7 \left( \mathbb{Z}[x] \right)$ - The ring of $7\times 7$ matrices whose elements are polynomials with coefficients from the ring of integers.
* $M_4 \left(\mathbb{C} \right)[x]$ - The ring of polynomials whose coefficients are $4 \times 4$ matrices  where the matrix elements are from the ring of complex numbers.
