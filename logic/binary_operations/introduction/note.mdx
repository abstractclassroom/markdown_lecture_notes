# Binary Logic Operations 

A binary operation is simply an operation with two inputs.  Traditional operations like addition and multiplication are examples of such operations. Binary logic operations are essentially operations traditionally found in programming languages and digital circuits.  The inputs are from the set below.

$$\{\underbrace{\text{true}}_{1}, \underbrace{\text{false}}_{0}\}$$

Operations on a set must be closed.  This means that the result of the operation will also be an element in the set.  As a result every binary logic operation will have an operation table like the one below where $x\in \{0,1\}$.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\diagbox{$A$}{$B$} & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & $x$ & $x$ \\
\hline
1 & $x$ & $x$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
