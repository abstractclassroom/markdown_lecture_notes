    "description" : "RSA is probably the most widely used form of public-key encryption. It is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. The security of RSA relies on the fact that it is easy to multiply large prime numbers together, but very difficult to factor the product of two large prime numbers. In this lesson, we will discuss the mathematics behind RSA encryption and how it is used to secure communications over the internet.",
